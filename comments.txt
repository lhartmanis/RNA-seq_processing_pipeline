The Sjdb overhang parameter gets specified in STAR genome generate and can lead to potential problems when mapping reads with different read lengths. Ideally, one would generate a new genome for each run, but Alex Dobin recommends against this, since the effects will be marginal. For more information read github issue below

left to do:
- Make gnu time a requirement and callable from the config file
- Check why file renaming did not work properly
- add a requirements.txt file
